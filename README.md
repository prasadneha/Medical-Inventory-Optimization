Enhancing Healthcare Efficiency through Inventory Optimization

Objective: This project targets the prevalent issue of high bounce rates within a healthcare organization, contributing to patient dissatisfaction. The primary aim is to mitigate bounce rates by a minimum of 30%, concurrently reducing inventory expenses. The anticipated outcome includes a revenue boost of at least 20 lakhs INR. Employing a Data Analytics Project Management Methodology, the project will engage with a dataset comprising 14,218 rows and 14 columns, centering on the Supply Chain Management department.

Summary of Approach: The project encompasses two core phases: data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Mysql and Python both. The pre-processing phase involves data cleansing and normalization. The subsequent EDA phase employs statistical techniques to grasp data distribution and attributes, particularly focusing on bounce rates and customer satisfaction issues within specific drug subcategories and formulations.

Key Insights:

Data cleansing resulted in more consistent distributions, pivotal for precise decision-making.
Analysis unveiled a notable 24.9% bounce rate, indicating substantial customer discontent.
Certain subcategories such as "INJECTIONS" and "TABLETS & CAPSULES," along with the "Form1" formulation, exhibited heightened return frequencies.
Observations of seasonal fluctuations in hospital operations highlighted varying revenue and demand patterns across different months.

Recommendations:

Thorough scrutiny of "INJECTIONS" and "TABLETS & CAPSULES" subcategories to pinpoint and rectify factors contributing to elevated return rates.
Comprehensive evaluation of the "Form1" formulation to explore enhancements or alternative options.
Assessment and potential reevaluation of suppliers, particularly those associated with Department1 and the "Form1" formulation.
Streamlined inventory management within Department1 to optimize stock levels and curtail returns.
Introduction of effective return management protocols in Department1.
Adoption of specialization-specific tactics, especially within Specialization4 and Specialization7, to address heightened return rates.
Strategic allocation of resources in accordance with seasonal demands to optimize operational efficiency during peak and off-peak periods.
By adhering to these recommendations and addressing identified areas of concern, the project endeavors to significantly diminish bounce rates, enhance customer satisfaction, and elevate the overall performance and revenue of the hospital.
