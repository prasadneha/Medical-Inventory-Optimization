Enhancing Healthcare Efficiency through Inventory Optimization

Objective: This project targets the prevalent issue of high bounce rates within a healthcare organization, contributing to patient dissatisfaction. The primary aim is to mitigate bounce rates by a minimum of 30%, concurrently reducing inventory expenses. The anticipated outcome includes a revenue boost of at least 20 lakhs INR. Employing a Data Analytics Project Management Methodology, the project will engage with a dataset comprising 14,218 rows and 14 columns, centering on the Supply Chain Management department.

Summary of Approach: The project encompasses two core phases: data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Mysql and Python both. The pre-processing phase involves data cleansing and normalization. The subsequent EDA phase employs statistical techniques to grasp data distribution and attributes, particularly focusing on bounce rates and customer satisfaction issues within specific drug subcategories and formulations.

Key Insights:

1. Data cleansing fosters more robust distributions, pivotal for precision in decision-making processes.
2. Analysis unveils a notable 24.9% bounce rate, indicative of considerable customer discontent.
3. Certain subcategories such as "INJECTIONS" and "TABLETS & CAPSULES," along with the "Form1" formulation, emerge with elevated return counts.
4. Observations pinpoint seasonal fluctuations in hospital operations, influencing revenue streams and demand across different months.

Recommendations:

1. Conduct an exhaustive scrutiny of subcategories like "INJECTIONS" and "TABLETS & CAPSULES" to unearth and rectify factors driving high return rates.
2. Undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the "Form1" formulation for potential enhancements or alternative solutions.
3. Assess and, if necessary, reconsider suppliers, particularly those tied to Department1 and the "Form1" formulation.
4. Bolster inventory management protocols within Department1 to optimize stock levels and curtail returns.
5. Establish streamlined return management mechanisms within Department1.
6. Deploy specialization-specific tactics, particularly in Specialisation4 and Specialisation7, to tackle heightened return rates.
7. Strategically allocate resources seasonally to optimize operational efficiency and resource utilization during peak and off-peak periods.
By implementing these stratagems and honing in on identified pain points, the project endeavors to markedly diminish bounce rates, elevate customer contentment, and augment the overall performance and revenue of the hospital.
